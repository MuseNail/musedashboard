# Back Office — Kickoff & Structure Plan

> **Status: PLANNING (structure locked here before any code).**
> Back Office is a standalone, multi-business financial-operations app (accounting, bank CSV import, AI categorization, vendor rules, inventory, reports, QuickBooks Desktop export). It is the THIRD product in the family: Muse (this repo, live salon app) → Back Office (this plan). It does NOT live inside Muse — Muse syncs finalized financial data INTO it, one-way.

## 0. Decisions & defaults (owner can override any of these before M0)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Repo | New GitHub repo `MuseNail/backoffice`, GitHub Pages at `/backoffice/` | TurnDesk precedent; Muse repo stays untouched |
| Cloudflare | Isolated Worker `backoffice` in the existing CF account (`info@musenailandspa.com`), own DO class + R2 bucket + secrets | Same as the TurnDesk account decision — CF requires unique email per account; isolation is per-Worker/DO, billing login shared |
| Stack | Same as Muse: static PWA (no build step, vanilla ES modules, Tailwind CDN) + Cloudflare Worker + Durable Objects + R2 | Proven, owner-operable, zero build infra |
| Tenancy | **One Durable Object per business** (`BusinessDO`, `idFromName(businessId)`) | Hard data separation — one business physically cannot read another's DO |
| Ledger | **Double-entry under the hood, single-entry UX** | P&L + Balance Sheet + QuickBooks export all require it; retrofitting later is painful |
| Auth | **Per-user sessions on EVERY Worker route from day one**: identifier + PIN → session token; membership checked server-side before any business data is touched (see §3b) | Muse's biggest open debt (§13) — do not repeat it; clients must only ever see their own business |
| WebSockets | **Hibernation API from day one** (`state.acceptWebSocket()`) | Lesson from Muse's free-tier outage; non-hibernating WS bills DO duration continuously |
| Storage keys | All browser storage prefixed `bo_` (never `muse_`/`turndesk_`) | Same GitHub Pages origin → localStorage/CacheStorage are shared per-ORIGIN |
| QB export | IIF format (QuickBooks Desktop's import format) | Design the COA with IIF account-type vocabulary in mind from day one |
| AI categorization | Worker-side call to the Claude API (`/ai/categorize`, batch) — suggestions only, never auto-post | API key stays server-side (Muse's proxy pattern); model picked at build time |

## 1. What we port from Muse vs. what we do differently

**Port (the small, proven core — adapt, don't copy blindly):**
- `store.js` / `sync.js` / `session.js` — optimistic `dispatch`, offline outbox, stale-write guards, snapshot hydration, echo suppression.
- DO entity-per-key persistence pattern (`customer:<id>` → here `txn:<id>`, `account:<id>`, …) + R2 snapshot backups via DO `alarm()`.
- `auth.js` PIN/role concepts (re-shaped for per-business users).
- Worker proxy pattern (secrets server-side; client never holds API keys).
- `utils.js` pieces as needed: numpad, toast, money formatting, `xlsxBlob()`, PDF helpers.

**Do differently (the lessons):**
1. **No window-glue / no inline `onclick=`.** Muse's 234KB `index.html` + 241KB `reports.js` are the direct result of one global HTML file wired by inline handlers. Back Office: `index.html` is a thin shell (header + nav + one `<div id="view">`); each screen is a view module that renders its own DOM and binds events with `addEventListener`/delegation. This single rule is what keeps modules small.
2. **A real (tiny) view router.** Hash-based (`#/business/<id>/ledger`), `main.js` mounts/unmounts view modules. No framework — a ~50-line router.
3. **Worker as multiple source files.** `wrangler` bundles with esbuild, so the Worker can be modular (`src/routes/*.js`) without violating the no-client-build rule. Muse's 66KB single `worker.js` doesn't need repeating.
4. **Auth middleware first, routes second.** Every route except nothing (no exceptions) goes through the bearer check.
5. **Schema versioning from day one.** Each DO stores `schema_version`; migrations are explicit functions run on DO wake.

Rules carried over from Muse: section markers `// ── Name ──…`, no comments explaining WHAT, version bump = `config.js` + `version.json` + `sw.js` CACHE_NAME together.

## 3. Data model (entities inside each BusinessDO)

Every record carries `updatedAt`/`updatedBy` (stale-write guard, same as Muse) and belongs to exactly one business by construction (it lives in that business's DO).

| Key | Entity | Fields (core) |
|---|---|---|
| `meta` | Business profile | name, industry, fiscal year start, settings, `schema_version` |
| `user:<id>` | Business user | name, PIN hash, role (`owner` / `manager` / `bookkeeper` / `viewer`), permissions |
| `account:<id>` | COA account | name, type (`asset` / `liability` / `equity` / `income` / `cogs` / `expense`), subtype, parentId, qbName + qbType (IIF mapping), active |
| `txn:<id>` | Ledger transaction | date, payeeVendorId?, memo, **lines[] `{accountId, amountCents}` summing to 0**, status (`staged` → `posted` → `void`), source `{app, sourceId, importId}`, reconciledIn? |
| `bankacct:<id>` | Bank/credit-card account | name, institution, kind (`checking` / `savings` / `card` / `cash`), linked `account:<id>`, saved CSV mapping presets |
| `import:<id>` | Import batch | bankacctId, filename, importedAt, mapping used, row/dup/posted counts, status |
| `staged:<id>` | Staged bank row | importId, raw row, normalized `{date, desc, amountCents}`, dedupHash, suggestion `{accountId, by: rule/ai/history, confidence}`, status (`pending` / `approved` / `skipped` / `duplicate`) |
| `vendor:<id>` | Vendor / supplier | name, matchers `{exact[], keywords[]}`, defaultAccountId, defaultMemo, isSupplier |
| `item:<id>` | Inventory item | name, supplierId, unit, qtyOnHand, avgUnitCostCents, restockAt |
| `purchase:<id>` | Restock / purchase | itemId, supplierId, qty, unitCostCents, txnId link, receipt file ref |
| `recon:<id>` | Reconciliation session | bankacctId, statementEndDate, statementBalanceCents, clearedTxnIds[], status |
| `lock:<period>` | Period lock | closed accounting periods reject postings (Muse payroll-lock precedent) |

**RegistryDO (one global instance):** `business:<id>` (id, name, industry, createdAt) + `membership:<userId>:<businessId>` (role). The owner belongs to all businesses; clients belong only to theirs.

**Money is integer cents everywhere.** No floats in stored data, ever.

### 3b. Access & visibility model — HARD REQUIREMENT (owner, 2026-06-11)

> Clients get access ONLY to their own business. A Muse user must not even be able to learn that "Pham Properties LLC" *exists* — no name, no id, no count of other businesses — let alone see its data. The owner sees and switches between all businesses.

**Enforcement is server-side; the UI merely reflects it.** Hiding a nav item is not the wall — the Worker is.

1. **Login flow:** user enters identifier + PIN → Worker checks credentials → issues a session token. The login response (and every later response) contains ONLY the businesses that user is a member of. A single-business user's session literally never carries another business's name or id over the wire.
2. **Worker middleware:** every `/b/:businessId/*` request resolves the session user's membership in that business (RegistryDO) BEFORE the request touches the BusinessDO. Non-members get the same `403` whether the business exists or not — no enumeration, no existence leak.
3. **DO isolation as the backstop:** even a middleware bug can only ever expose ONE business's DO per request path — there is no query that spans businesses, because there is no shared table to query.
4. **UI shaping:** a single-business user gets NO business switcher (the business name renders as a static label), NO "Businesses" screen, and lands directly in their business after PIN entry. Only multi-business users (the owner) get the switcher + selector.
5. **Files too:** R2 receipt/statement objects are keyed `b/<businessId>/...` and served only through the same membership check — no public URLs.

**Client-login hardening (because clients sign in from their own devices over the internet):** a bare 4-digit PIN is not enough remotely. Plan: per-device enrollment (first sign-in on a new device requires owner approval or a one-time invite code) + rate-limited PIN attempts with lockout. PIN stays the daily convenience; the enrolled device is the second factor. Details locked at M2.

**Posting invariants (enforced in `lib/posting.js` AND in the DO on write):**
- lines sum to exactly 0; at least 2 lines; every line references an active account
- posting into a locked period is rejected
- staged → posted is the ONLY path for imported rows (no silent auto-posting)
- `void` reverses, never deletes — the ledger is append-only

---

## 4. Core workflows

**Business setup wizard:** name → industry pick → COA template applied from `coa-templates.js` (e.g. *Salon/Spa*, *Retail*, *Restaurant*, *Services*, *Generic*) → opening balances (optional) → first user (owner PIN). Templates are data, not code — adding an industry is adding an array.

**Bank import:** upload CSV → `csv.js` parses + auto-detects columns (date/description/amount, or debit+credit pair; falls back to manual mapping UI; mapping saved per bank account) → preview → dedup (`dedupHash = date+amountCents+normalized-desc` checked against existing staged AND posted) → staged rows created under an `import:<id>`.

**Categorization (in priority order, on the staging screen):** ① exact vendor match → ② keyword rule → ③ history match (same normalized desc previously approved) → ④ AI suggestion (batched to `/ai/categorize`). Every suggestion shows its source + confidence. **User approves; approval posts** the double-entry txn (bank account line + category line) linked to the import. "Make this a rule" is one tap from any approval.

**Reconciliation:** pick bank account + statement end date + end balance → app shows posted txns in range → check off cleared → difference must reach $0.00 to close → closed session stamps `reconciledIn` on the txns.

**Reports:** P&L (date range, cash basis first; accrual later if ever needed), Balance Sheet (as-of date), sales/expense summaries by account/vendor/month, tax-estimate summary (configurable % buckets). Excel-style `.data-table` layout (owner preference), CSV/XLSX/PDF export reusing Muse's helpers.

**QuickBooks Desktop export:** `qb-iif.js` writes `!ACCNT` (COA) and `!TRNS`/`!SPL` (transactions) IIF sections using each account's `qbName`/`qbType`. Export by date range; mark exported txns so re-export warns about duplicates.

---

## 5. Sync contract — Muse → Back Office (one-way, additive)

- **Direction:** Muse pushes; Back Office receives at `POST /sync/inbound`. **No reverse channel exists at all** — "no destructive sync back" is structural.
- **Payload:** finalized records only (paid transactions / daily sales summaries, gift-card liability movements, payroll summaries), each with `{sourceApp:'musenail', sourceId, businessId}`.
- **Idempotent:** upsert keyed on `sourceApp+sourceId` — re-pushing the same record is a no-op.
- **Lands as STAGED**, mapped via a saved "Muse mapping" (sales → income account, tips → liability, gift cards sold → liability, payroll → expense). Owner approves into the ledger like any import. Day one fallback: Muse's existing CSV exports through the normal import wizard — the live sync is a later milestone.
- **Hard prerequisite: Muse §13 Worker auth.** The Muse Worker is still unauthenticated; the sync touchpoint in the Muse repo (one small additive push hook) must land behind the shared-bearer-token work. Until then, CSV is the bridge.
- TurnDesk sync: moot — TurnDesk is superseded; any future product built from current Muse inherits this same contract.

## 6. Build milestones (each small, testable, shippable)

| # | Milestone | Proof it works |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Repo bootstrap: shell + router + Worker w/ auth + empty `BusinessDO` + deploy | Pages loads; `GET /b/test/state` 401s without token, returns empty state with it |
| M1 | Business registry + setup wizard + COA templates | Create 2 businesses; each gets its own COA; data provably isolated |
| M2 | Users / PIN / roles + §3b access model (sessions, membership middleware, device enrollment, rate limiting) | PIN login; viewer can't edit; owner sees both businesses; **a client user's session provably never carries the other business's name/id; non-member request → indistinguishable 403** |
| M3 | Chart of accounts CRUD | Add/rename/archive accounts; tree renders; template + custom coexist |
| M4 | Posting engine + manual ledger entry + journal entries | `tests/posting` pass; unbalanced entry rejected; ledger renders |
| M5 | Bank accounts + CSV import wizard + staging | Import 3 different real bank CSVs; columns auto-detect; dups flagged |
| M6 | Vendor rules + history matching | Rule auto-suggests on next import; "make rule" from approval works |
| M7 | AI categorization (`/ai/categorize`) | Unmatched rows get suggestions; nothing posts without approval |
| M8 | Reconciliation | Reconcile a real statement to $0.00 |
| M9 | Reports: P&L, Balance Sheet, summaries, tax estimate | P&L ties to the ledger by hand-check; BS balances |
| M10 | Inventory + suppliers + purchases | Restock updates qty + posts the linked txn |
| M11 | Muse → Back Office sync (AFTER Muse §13 auth ships) | Muse day pushes land as staged rows; re-push is a no-op |
| M12 | QuickBooks IIF export | Exported file imports into QB Desktop cleanly |

Testing gates (from the strategy doc, every milestone): business isolation, no auto-posting, import history present, report accuracy hand-checked.

## 7. Data integrity rules (restated as build constraints)

1. Every record lives inside one business's DO — cross-business access is impossible by construction, not by query filter.
2. Imported/synced rows are ALWAYS staged; only explicit user approval posts.
3. The ledger is append-only: void/reverse, never delete or mutate posted amounts.
4. Every import and every synced record carries its provenance (`import:<id>` / `sourceApp+sourceId`).
5. AI suggests; the user approves. No exceptions.
6. R2 snapshot backups via DO `alarm()` from M1 (not bolted on later).
7. Integer cents; no floats in stored data.
